# Privacy Policy for OG Image Grabber

**Last updated:** [Current Date]

## Introduction

OG Image Grabber ("we," "our," or "us") is a browser extension that allows users to quickly extract and view Open Graph (og:image) metadata from web pages. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our extension.

## Information We Collect

### What We Don't Collect
- **Personal Information**: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information such as names, email addresses, or browsing history.
- **User Data**: We do not collect or store any data about your browsing activities, visited websites, or personal preferences.
- **Analytics**: We do not use tracking technologies or analytics services.

### What We Do Collect
- **Extension Usage**: Basic usage statistics may be collected by the browser's extension system (managed by your browser, not by us).
- **Technical Data**: Standard browser extension permissions and functionality data.

## How We Use Information

Our extension operates entirely locally on your device:

1. **Image Extraction**: When you click the extension icon, it reads the current webpage's HTML to find og:image metadata.
2. **Local Processing**: All processing happens locally in your browser - no data is sent to external servers.
3. **Display**: The extracted image URL is displayed in the extension popup for your convenience.

## Data Storage

- **No Server Storage**: We do not maintain any servers or databases to store your information.
- **Local Storage**: Any temporary data is stored locally in your browser's extension storage and is automatically cleared when you close the browser.
- **No Cookies**: We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies.

## Permissions

Our extension requires the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: Allows the extension to access the current tab to read webpage content and extract og:image metadata.
- **scripting**: Enables the extension to inject scripts into the current tab to read HTML content.

These permissions are necessary for the core functionality of the extension and are used only when you actively interact with the extension.

## Third-Party Services

We do not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or external data processors. All functionality is self-contained within the extension.

## Data Security

Since we do not collect or transmit any personal data, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to your information. All processing occurs locally on your device.

## Children's Privacy

Our extension does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. Since we don't collect personal information from any users, this is not applicable.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by updating the version number in the extension manifest and posting the updated policy.

## Your Rights

- Uninstall the extension at any time through your browser's extension management.
- Disable the extension temporarily if needed.
